The purpose of this code is to receive inputs representing grade values for different aspects of class and sum them to calculate the total score for the class. 
For example, if a student were to input a value 15 for HW, 15 for CodeLab, 20 for Midterm 1, 20 for Midterm 2, and 30 for the final exam, their total score would be 100.
